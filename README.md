This repository demonstrates a common yet difficult-to-debug performance issue in React Native's FlatList component when dealing with substantial datasets and intricate item renderings. The bug showcases a scenario where inefficient rendering leads to significant performance degradation, eventually causing the app to freeze or crash.  The solution involves optimizing the rendering process by employing techniques like item memoization, windowing, and virtualization. This example highlights the importance of efficient data handling and rendering optimization for building performant React Native applications.
