This React Native bug is triggered when using the `FlatList` component with a large dataset and complex item rendering.  The issue manifests as a significant performance slowdown or even crashes. It's often caused by inefficient rendering or excessive re-renders of list items.  The root cause is usually not immediately apparent in the code itself, making it a challenging bug to diagnose.
